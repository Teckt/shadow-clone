# üöÄ Shadow Clone AI Pipeline - Complete Setup Guide

## What is Shadow Clone?

**Shadow Clone** is your autonomous AI development team that can perform all the tasks a human development team can do:

- üèóÔ∏è **Create entire projects** from natural language descriptions
- üîç **Review code automatically** with security and quality analysis  
- üåü **Develop new features** end-to-end (branch ‚Üí code ‚Üí tests ‚Üí PR)
- üêõ **Fix bugs** by analyzing issues and implementing solutions
- üöÄ **Deploy applications** with automated CI/CD pipelines
- üí° **Brainstorm ideas** for new features and improvements

## GitHub Copilot vs Shadow Clone

| Feature | GitHub Copilot (Your Subscription) | Shadow Clone (This System) |
|---------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Code completion assistant | Autonomous development team |
| **Scope** | Helps you write code | Manages entire projects |
| **Usage** | Works as you type in editor | Takes high-level instructions |
| **Integration** | Built into VS Code | Standalone service with APIs |
| **AI Provider** | GitHub's models | OpenAI/Anthropic (your API keys) |

**They work together!** Copilot helps you code faster, while Shadow Clone automates entire workflows.

## ü§ù Working with GitHub Copilot Coding Agent

Shadow Clone and GitHub Copilot Coding Agent work perfectly together in a hierarchical workflow:

### The Perfect Development Hierarchy

1. **Shadow Clone (Senior/Manager)**: Creates projects, sets architecture, delegates tasks
2. **GitHub Copilot Coding Agent (Developer)**: Implements assigned issues and creates PRs
3. **Shadow Clone (Reviewer)**: Reviews and approves/denies Copilot's PRs

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Shadow Clone creates entire project
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/instructions \
  -d '{"instructions": "Create a modern blog platform with React frontend, Node.js backend, and MongoDB. Include user authentication, post editor, and comment system."}'

# Shadow Clone creates:
# - blog-frontend repository with React app
# - blog-backend repository with Node.js API
# - Complete CI/CD pipelines
# - Database schemas
# - 15+ GitHub issues for improvements

# 2. Assign issues to GitHub Copilot in the created repositories
# Go to any issue in the created repos and assign to @copilot

# 3. Shadow Clone reviews Copilot's PRs automatically
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/review/pull-request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "repository": {"owner": "your-username", "name": "blog-frontend"},
    "pullNumber": 123
  }'
```

### Benefits of This Approach

- **üöÄ Faster Project Creation**: Shadow Clone builds entire applications in minutes
- **ÔøΩ Continuous Development**: Copilot handles ongoing features and bug fixes  
- **üìä Quality Control**: Shadow Clone ensures architectural consistency
- **‚ö° Scalable**: Multiple Copilot agents can work on different parts simultaneously

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up the Workflow

### Step 1: Get Your API Keys

You'll need these API keys (separate from your Copilot subscription):

1. **GitHub Personal Access Token**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Create token with these permissions:
     ```
     ‚úì repo (full repository access)
     ‚úì workflow (manage GitHub Actions)
     ‚úì write:packages
     ‚úì read:org
     ‚úì admin:repo_hook
     ```

2. **OpenAI API Key** (recommended)
   - Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Create new key
   - Choose GPT-4 model for best results

3. **Anthropic API Key** (optional, for Claude models)
   - Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Create API key

### Step 2: Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy the environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env file with your keys
notepad .env
```

Replace the placeholder values:
```env
# Required - Your GitHub token
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token_here

# Required - At least one AI provider
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your_anthropic_key_here

# Application settings
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
```

### Step 3: Install and Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Build the project (already done)
npm run build

# Start Shadow Clone
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
üöÄ AI GitHub Pipeline is running!
üìä Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

## ü§ñ GitHub Integration (Automated Workflows)

### Setup GitHub Webhooks

1. **Go to your repository settings**
2. **Click "Webhooks"**
3. **Add webhook:**
   - URL: `https://your-domain.com/webhooks/github`
   - Content type: `application/json`
   - Events: `Issues`, `Pull requests`, `Push`

### Automated Behaviors

Once webhooks are set up, Shadow Clone automatically:

- **Issue labeled "feature"** ‚Üí Creates feature branch, implements code, tests, creates PR
- **Issue labeled "bug"** ‚Üí Analyzes bug, creates fix, tests, creates PR  
- **Pull request opened** ‚Üí Reviews code, suggests improvements, runs security scan
- **Push to main** ‚Üí Runs tests, deploys if tests pass

## üé® Advanced Usage Examples

### 1. Full-Stack App Development
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/instructions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "instructions": "Build a complete e-commerce platform with React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, Stripe payments, admin dashboard, inventory management, order tracking, and email notifications. Include comprehensive tests and CI/CD."
  }'
```

### 2. Microservices Architecture
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/instructions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "instructions": "Create a microservices architecture with user service, product service, order service, payment service, and API gateway. Use Docker, Kubernetes, and implement service discovery, monitoring, and logging."
  }'
```

### 3. Bug Investigation and Fix
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/instructions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "instructions": "Investigate the memory leak in the user session management reported in issue #456. Find the root cause, implement a fix, add tests to prevent regression, and update documentation."
  }'
```

### 4. Performance Optimization
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/instructions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "instructions": "Optimize the application performance by implementing caching, database query optimization, code splitting, lazy loading, and CDN integration. Provide before/after performance metrics."
  }'
```

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Agents

Create agents for specialized tasks:

```typescript
// src/agents/mobile/MobileAgent.ts
export class MobileAgent {
  async createMobileApp(requirements: any) {
    // Implement React Native or Flutter app creation
  }
}
```

### Custom Workflows

```typescript
// Add to WorkflowEngine
createMobileAppWorkflow(): Workflow {
  return {
    id: 'mobile-app-development',
    steps: [
      { id: 'setup-project', type: 'action' },
      { id: 'create-ui', type: 'action' },
      { id: 'implement-features', type: 'action' },
      { id: 'test-app', type: 'action' },
      { id: 'deploy-stores', type: 'action' }
    ]
  };
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"API key not working"**
   - Check `.env` file has correct keys
   - Ensure no extra spaces in keys
   - Verify API key permissions

2. **"Cannot create repository"**
   - Check GitHub token permissions
   - Ensure token has `repo` scope

3. **"AI responses are slow"**
   - OpenAI GPT-4 is recommended but slower
   - Try GPT-3.5-turbo for faster responses
   - Check API rate limits

4. **"Webhook not receiving events"**
   - Ensure public URL (use ngrok for testing)
   - Check webhook payload URL
   - Verify secret matches

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Start with detailed logging
DEBUG=* npm run dev

# View logs
tail -f logs/combined.log
```

## üí° Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: "Add authentication" vs "Add JWT-based authentication with email/password login, password reset, and session management"

2. **Include Context**: "Add user profiles to the existing React app with the current PostgreSQL database"

3. **Specify Technology**: "Use TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL"

4. **Request Tests**: "Include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests"

5. **Ask for Documentation**: "Include API documentation and setup instructions"
